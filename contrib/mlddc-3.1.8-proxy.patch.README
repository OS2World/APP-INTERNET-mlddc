This patch adds support for HTTP proxies to MLDDC.

[ It's againt MLDDC 3.1.8 and you may have to apply it by hand to newer versions.
  If your ISP blocks outgoing connections to port 80 please try the secure
  version of MLDDC ( http://ii.pw.edu.pl/~skawina/mlddcs.tgz ) first, and if that
  does not work, send me an email (skawina@usa.net) and I'll consider adding
  this functionality. AS ]
