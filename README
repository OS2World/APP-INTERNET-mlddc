mlddc is a client for the Monolith ( http://www.ml.org )
dynamic DNS ( DYNDNS, http://www.ml.org/dyndns/ ) service.
It updates the ML database and nameservers with the current IP.



   USAGE
   _____

'mlddc' reads your hostname (without ".dyn.ml.org"), MID and
password from stdin.

You can either create a file with this info and type:

"mlddc <mymldata"

or use 'mlupd'.

In any case make sure that the file with your password can 
not be read or executed by anyone else (eg "chmod 700 mlupd" ).

This kind of info can't be passed on the command line because
then anybody would be able find out your password by typing "ps axwww".

To "deactivate" your host use "mlddc d <mymldata" or "mlupd d".

If you would like to run mlddc from ip-up and/or keep a log file and are using
bash, you can run it as:

 (mlupd 2>&1) >>/var/log/mlddc
 
or

 (mlddc <mymldata 2>&1) >>/var/log/mlddc
